## About Athena

Athena is about helping people pay down their home loan faster. Athena's variable AcceleRATES are based off your LVR (loan-to-value ratio) tiers where we lower your rate based off how much you’ve paid down your loan†.
When you permanently pay down your Straight Up or Power Up loan to reach the lower LVR tier, we’ll drop your rate - automatically!

>You don’t even have to ask. It’s an Aussie first to reward you for reducing your loan.
