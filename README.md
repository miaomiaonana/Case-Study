## About Athena

Athena is about helping people pay down their home loan faster. Athena's variable AcceleRATES are based off your LVR (loan-to-value ratio) tiers where we lower your rate based off how much you’ve paid down your loan†.
When you permanently pay down your Straight Up or Power Up loan to reach the lower LVR tier, we’ll drop your rate - automatically!

>You don’t even have to ask. It’s an Aussie first to reward you for reducing your loan.


## Tech

Athena’s custom in-house built tech allows clients to check against more factors faster.

-Their pre-approval is super accurate because your numbers are verified instantly

-They’ve built a fully automated credit scorecard

-They’ve co-designed the experience with their customers


## Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses?

Athena offers everyone a great interest rate to start off with, but as your payments reduce the amount owing, your rate automatically decreases with discounts applied for loans with an LVR of less than 70% and a further discount when the loan limbos under the 60% bar.
-Strengths - No application fees, annual/monthly service fees or discharge exit fees. Interest rates reduces as LVR reduces. 
-Weaknesses - No savings accounts, credit cards and/or banks accounts. Only Home loans. 

## What is the prognosis for this company? Where do they expect to be in the future?

Building and inspiring a talented team dedicated to the cause of innovating to deliver customers a better deal.
Since launch, almost 400 Athena customers have dropped their own rate and on average saved $56,000 over the life of their loan with 15% saving over $100,000. 80% of all Athena customers are ahead on their repayments with an average customer 3 years ahead.
